# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is a prototype of a self-guided training resource which is open, online and collaboratively curated. The en goal is learning hub which aims to help librarians who want to develop the skills and the knowledge needed to work with digital collections and with data.

We will present this prototype to participants attending the workshop on _Digital Scholarship & Data Science Essentials for Library Professionals_ at the LIBER Winter Event 2023. It is meant to serve as inspiration and provide a basis for feedback on an ideal learning hub.

This 'book' is built with Quarto and hosted on GitHub. It is entirely open(-source) and therefore the community can actively engage with developing and maintaining it. With a bit of extra setup, it would be possible for users to contribute to the book directly on GitHub. All that would be needed is knowledge of Markdown syntax and some familiarity of a typical GitHub workflow via the web browser.

Let us know what you think!
