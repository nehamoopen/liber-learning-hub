# Contributing {.unnumbered}

In order to contribute to the book, you can refer to the **chapter template** that is provided in this section. The chapter template provides an outline on how to structure your contribution, so all chapters and content in the learning hub can be aligned.

It is possible to submit your contribution as a Word document. However, a document following Markdown syntax would be even better. The submission will then be (manually) incorporated into the book by the maintainers.

Alternatively. you could make a 'pull request' on GitHub. This means writing your chapter directly on GitHub (using Markdown syntax) and requesting a review and eventual merge of your contribution. Once merged, the book will automatically be updated GitHub.
