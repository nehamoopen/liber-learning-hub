    "text": "2.2 What are Large Language Models (LLMs)?\nA large language model (LLM) is a type of machine learning model that can perform natural language processing tasks such as generating and classifying text, answering questions, and translating text.\nIf your eyes just crossed reading that sentence, no wonder, there’s a lot of terminology and jargon to unpack there in that one little sentence. Let’s go back a few steps and take it a little slower!\nIt helps to first understand a little bit about what machine learning is. Machine learning (ML) is a core technology that underpins a lot of work in artificial intelligence work today. Artificial intelligence is actually a broad field that encompasses the development of systems and machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as reasoning, problem-solving, learning, and perception, and…chatting!\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) is a specialised area within artificial intelligence (AI) that looks specifically at the challenges of processing and understanding human language (another is Computer Vision (CV) which is, on the other hand, concerned with helping computers process and understand imagery in the vein of human vision). NLP plays a vital role in enhancing the capabilities of AI systems by working to make them more capable of natural and effective interaction with humans.\nNLP involves the development of algorithms, models, and systems for analysing, understanding and extracting meaningful information from textual data representing human language. The field relies heavily on the use of machine learning to make sense of our complex textual data, which might come from literature, historical documents, articles, twitter, wikipedia, you name it!\nMachine learning involves the development of algorithms and models that allow computers to learn patterns and relationships from data and make predictions on new data. Instead of being explicitly programmed for specific tasks, ML algorithms use data to learn and improve their performance over time.\nA machine learning algorithm is designed to recognize patterns, relationships, and trends in data and will adjust their internal parameters based on examples to improve their performance over time.\nA machine learning model represents what was learned by a machine learning algorithm. The model that’s created in the process and saved after running a machine learning algorithm on training data and represents the rules, numbers, and any other algorithm-specific data structures required to make predictions on new data.\nSo back to our definition:\nA large language model (LLM) is a type of machine learning model that can perform natural language processing tasks such as generating and classifying text, answering questions, and translating text.\nLanguage models are a type of machine learning model designed to predict the likelihood of a sequence of text, which means that they can be set up to predict the most likely way to continue a conversation. The models behind ChatGPT are large, complex neural networks that have been exposed to an enormous amount of text from books, articles, websites, and more. These models have learned something about patterns in grammar and word meaning, including the way that meaning arises contextually across multiple sentences and multiple turns in a conversation. When you ask ChatGPT a question, you are presenting the model with new information it tries to make a prediction on, in this case, it tries to generate a response that matches the pattern of conversation. Large language models are trained on massive amounts of text data and are essentially the backbone of NLP today. There are and have been for many years, large language models out there actually but ChatGPT has currently caught the popular imagination because of its publicly available interface and remarkable performance."

    "section": "2.3 What is ChatGPT?",
    "text": "2.3 What is ChatGPT?\nChatGPT is a platform providing an interface specifically to the large language models developed by OpenAI. The GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformers which is just a fancy way of saying that the models you are chatting with have already been trained on a lot of data.\nIt's a chatbot essentially designed to generate human-like text responses based on the input it receives. Or some say to think of it as a fancy predictive text generator. You ask questions or give prompts, and it provides responses in natural language, or rather, estimates what should come next in a conversation.\n\n2.3.1 What ChatGPT is NOT:\n\nGoogle Search Box: Unlike Google, ChatGPT doesn't search the internet for information. Instead, it generates responses based on a massive dataset it was trained on. This training dataset includes large segments of text sampled from the internet at a specific point in time, and so can reflect language describing content on the internet, but it doesn't have real-time access to the internet. When ChatGPT answers a question, it isn’t actually looking up information and then composing that information into a response; it's just making an estimation of a response based on patterns it has seen. So, when you ask it factual questions, especially ones with common answers or phrases, it might give you an answer that sounds right but remember this is because it’s mimicking what it has seen in its training data. Think of it perhaps as a very smart parrot, sometimes 'repeating' things it has seen before.\nHuman Mind: ChatGPT is not a human; it's a machine learning model. It doesn't understand or reason like a human. It generates evidently linguistic responses based on patterns it learned from text data.\n\n\n\n2.3.2 How ChatGPT Generates Responses:\n\nLanguage Modelling: So ChatGPT models are members of this class of models we’re talking about: “large language models” (LLMs). A machine learning model represents what was learned by a machine learning algorithm. The model is created and saved after running a machine learning algorithm on training data and represents the rules, numbers, and any other algorithm-specific data structures required to make predictions on new data. Language models are designed to predict the likelihood of a sequence of text, which means that they can be set up to predict the most likely way to continue a conversation. The models behind ChatGPT are large, complex neural networks that have been exposed to an enormous amount of text from books, articles, websites, and more. These models have learned something about patterns in grammar and word meaning, including the way that meaning arises contextually across multiple sentences and multiple turns in a conversation. When you ask ChatGPT a question, it tries to generate a response that matches these patterns.\nContextual Understanding: ChatGPT also looks at the context of the question you ask, including what’s happened so far in your conversation and any instructions or details you offer about how it should respond. It tries to understand the context and generate a response that is contextually relevant, which can make its answers seem quite accurate.\nExisting Knowledge: It can recall and blend information it has observed in its training data. So, when you ask a factual question, it can sometimes generate a response that seems factual because it has encountered similar information during training. But, it can also make mistakes or provide information that is outdated or biassed because it doesn't have the ability to verify the accuracy of what it says, and it is influenced by any views inherent in its training data, whether they are right or wrong. It's like the parrot repeating something it heard: it can't check if what it's saying is true or up-to-date. That's why it's important to double-check information output by ChatGPT with reliable sources, especially when using ChatGPT for research or critical tasks.\nUser Feedback Loop: ChatGPT models like the latest GPT-4 (openai.com) have been tuned and improved over time with user feedback, as part of a model training process known as “reinforcement learning”. So for example, when users request things like python code, and try it out, users provide feedback on whether or not it worked. This feedback helps the model get better at generating code that is more likely to work.\n\n\n\n2.3.3 When best to use ChatGPT:\n\nIdea Generation: ChatGPT can help brainstorm ideas for projects, essays, or creative endeavours. For example, you can ask it for ideas on new business ventures, book plots, or marketing campaigns.\nThesaurus and Rephrasing: It's excellent for finding synonyms, rephrasing sentences, or improving the clarity of your writing. You can ask it to provide alternative words or rewrite a paragraph for better readability.\nCreative Writing: ChatGPT can assist with creative writing tasks, including writing short stories, poems, or generating dialogues for characters.\nSome Learning and Explanation: It can provide explanations and answers to questions on a wide range of very general topics, making it useful for learning new concepts or understanding complex ideas. But again, always best to double check against other trusted resources.\nLanguage Translation: ChatGPT can offer some basic translation assistance, such as translating phrases or short sentences between languages.\nGenerating code snippets: It may not produce highly complex or critical code reliably but you can use it as a starting point for some common coding tasks.\n\n\n\nQuerying structured data: ChatGPT can provide outputs in the form of data structures including for instance SQL queries and JSON. So for instance if we have an SQL database with information about the content of a corpus, we can prompt ChatGPT to output queries that would apply to that database. We can then begin to imagine an interface where a non-expert user could make such a query using their own natural language, and ChatGPT could provide a connection with the structured data. This is sometimes referred to as “function calling” in the ChatGPT literature."

    "text": "2.6 Hands On Activity\nFor this activity we’ll primarily use the freely available ChatGPT (openai.com) interface. It’s also possible for those who may have more advanced skills to investigate using the API directly though it’s not free.\n\n2.6.1 Writing prompts\nTo get a useful response from ChatGPT, “prompting” is key. If you only ask a simple question, you may not be happy with the results and decide to dismiss the technology too quickly, but today’s purpose is to have a deeper play in order to develop our critical thinking and information evaluation skills, allowing us to make informed decisions about utilising tools like ChatGPT in our endeavours.\nSome best practices for writing a good prompt (helpful hints/tips gleaned from the readings above):\n\nGive the context. The more you explain the ins and outs of what you want ChatGPT to do, the more relevant your answer will be. For example, “You are an expert in [fill in the blank for your topic].”\nBe very specific and concrete about what you want it to do (and equally, what you don’t want it to do). For instance you may want to specify word count, how many items you’d like in a list, tone of voice, etc.\nGive clear instructions on what the output should look like, and be simple and concise in your language.\nProvide examples. Much like a human, ChatGPT often understands best when you provide an example for it to work with, especially if you want it to produce something that closely resembles something you’ve seen online.\nAsk ChatGPT to “act like” someone: Sometimes, it can help to start your prompt by asking ChatGPT to “act like” a certain type of person that would be particularly well-placed to respond to the query you're posing.\n\nIf you’re not satisfied with any part of the answer, you can keep building on it, asking ChatGPT to revise it in any way you like as it will continue on from previous enquiries in a session. (If you’d rather it not do that you can add “Please ignore all previous instructions” to start a prompt fresh). To learn more about prompting, there is a free online course: Learn Prompting."

If you're a history student in the UK researching the Third Plague Pandemic in India during the early 20th century, there are several archival resources you can explore to enhance your research. These archives will provide you with primary sources, documents, and historical records that can help you gain a deeper understanding of this important historical event. Here are some key archival resources to consider:\n1. **The National Archives (TNA) of the United Kingdom**:\n- TNA holds records related to British colonial administration in India during the early 20th century. Look for documents related to public health, sanitation, and official correspondence about the plague.\n2. **The India Office Records**:\n- These records are part of the British Library's holdings and contain a wealth of information on India during the colonial period. You can find reports, letters, and administrative documents related to the Third Plague Pandemic.\n3. **The British Library**:\n- The British Library has a substantial collection of materials related to India, including newspapers, periodicals, and publications from that era. You can find newspaper articles, books, and reports that discuss the plague's impact in India.\n4. **The Wellcome Collection**:\n- The Wellcome Collection in London has an extensive library and archive of materials related to the history of medicine. You may find documents, photographs, and medical reports pertaining to the plague in India.\n5. **Local Archives in India**:\n- Depending on your specific focus within India, you should also explore local archives and libraries. For example, the National Archives of India in Delhi and state archives may have valuable records.\n6. **Digital Collections**:\n- Many institutions, including the British Library and the Wellcome Collection, have digitized collections that you can access online. These digital resources can be very helpful for remote research.\n7. **University Libraries**:\n- Don't forget to check with your university's library. They may have subscriptions to digital archives and databases that can provide access to primary source materials and scholarly articles related to the Third Plague Pandemic in India.\n8. **Academic Journals**:\n- Look for scholarly articles in history and medical history journals. JSTOR and other academic databases can be valuable for finding secondary sources and research papers.\n9. **Interlibrary Loan Services**:\n- If you find a source or book that's not available in your university's library, you can request it through interlibrary loan services. This expands your access to materials from other institutions.\n10. **Archival Finding Aids**:\n- Be sure to use finding aids and catalog search tools provided by these institutions to locate specific documents and records related to the Third Plague Pandemic.\nRemember to take thorough notes, document your sources meticulously, and consult with your professors or advisors for guidance throughout your research process.
